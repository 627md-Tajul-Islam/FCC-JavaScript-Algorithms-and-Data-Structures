// One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations

// A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword

// So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.


let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";
