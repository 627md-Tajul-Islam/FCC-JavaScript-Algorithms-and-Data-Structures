// Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
// const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

const myName = "Tajul";
const myStr = "Hello" + myName + "is my name";
