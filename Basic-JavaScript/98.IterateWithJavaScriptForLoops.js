// for loop runs for a specific number of times.
// For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
// for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.
// The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. 
//It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.
