//In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say

// this is an old way
let no = 5;
no += 5;
console.log(no) 

// this is a new way
let myVar  = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
