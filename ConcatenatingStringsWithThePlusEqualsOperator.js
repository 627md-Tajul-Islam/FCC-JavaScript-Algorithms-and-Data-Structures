// We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.
let outStr = "i come first. ";
outStr += "I come second";
console.log(outStr);

let first = "I come here first";
first += "I come here second";
console.log(first);
