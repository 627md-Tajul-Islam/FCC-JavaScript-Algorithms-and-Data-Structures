// Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks = myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb ; // Change this line
console.log(wordBlanks)
// Only change code above this line
